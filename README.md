# wunderground_data

- I often find myself using wunderground data in various projects; it is very simple and easy to download yearly csv files of daily weather at any airport station.

- I decided that instead of always downloading the files, I would download them all once and put them in a sql database that can be queried from any project.

- This is in progress; I plan to make the database publicly available for others to use when it is done.
